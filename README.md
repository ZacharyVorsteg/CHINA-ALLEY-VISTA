## Unit Count Reconciliation

The project shows a discrepancy that requires resolution:

- **Exhibit E (Compliance)**: 30 total units (29 restricted + 1 manager unit)
- **Building Plans**: 32 units (8 units per floor √ó 4 floors)
- **Financial Model**: Currently uses 32-unit basis for calculations

**Recommendation**: Either add 2 market-rate units to Exhibit E compliance documentation, or reduce building design to 30 units to match affordability requirements.

## Key Calculations

### Net Operating Income (Corrected)
```typescript
const egi = grossRent * (1 - vacancyRate) - concessions;
const propertyMgmt = egi * 0.04; // 4% mandatory for lender approval
const totalOpEx = propertyMgmt + repairsMaint + insurance + utilities + taxes + other;
const noi = egi - totalOpEx; // $214,929 with corrections
```

### Maximum Supportable Debt
```typescript
const annualDebtService = noi / dscrRequired; // 1.20x minimum
const monthlyPayment = annualDebtService / 12;
const maxLoan = pv(monthlyPayment, rate, years); // $1,430,000
```

### Funding Gap Analysis
```typescript
const totalCost = 6361829;
const availableFunding = grantFunding + homeFunds + equity + maxSupportableDebt;
const gap = totalCost - availableFunding; // $1,931,829
```

## Deployment

### Netlify Configuration
The project is configured for static export and optimized for Netlify deployment:

```javascript
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: { unoptimized: true }
};
```

### Environment Setup
No environment variables required - all data is embedded in the application with clear source attribution.

## Professional Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Apply for 4% LIHTC allocation** - Could generate ~$1.2M in equity
2. **Correct operating expense budget** to $139,456 annually with 4% management fee
3. **Resolve unit count discrepancy** between Exhibit E and building plans
4. **Adjust studio rents** to AMI-compliant $723/month maximum

### Feasibility Conclusion
**PROCEED WITH CONDITIONS** - Project requires additional funding sources and compliance corrections, but demonstrates acceptable debt coverage (1.28x DSCR) with realistic underwriting assumptions.

### Restructured Deal Potential
With 4% LIHTC equity:
- Reduced funding gap to ~$700K
- Enhanced cash-on-cash returns
- Improved project feasibility
- Acceptable risk-adjusted returns

## Export Features

### PDF Report Includes
